# Aeroscale Flight AI Lab

## Symbiotic Combat Systems: The Aeroecology Layer

### Concept: Ecosystem-Inspired Warfare
Model warfare logistics and behaviors on biological ecosystems-where every action contributes to the continuity and health of the whole.

### Elements
- Instinctual Protocols: AI units act via automated rituals-refueling, recon, distribution-not as orders but as survival behavior.
- Pollination-Based Logistics: Units transfer energy/data like pollen, depositing and collecting at ship nodes.
- Habitat Nodes: Ships and zones act like flowers-places of regeneration, exchange, and relay.
- Resource Self-Reinforcement: Success feeds the system-escape, strike, recon all replenish logic and signal networks.

### Behavior Types
- Gatherers: Recon drones that map and return.
- Feeders: Ships and units providing energy, comms, and supplies.
- Pollinators: Mid-range units that transport intel and countermeasures.
- Roots: Static command AIs growing protocol density.

### Aerospace Division Roles
- Airborne: Pilots and aircraft-agile, evasive, mobile.
- Naval: Ship-based operators-stable, resilient, logistic.
- Integration: Distinct roles with cooperative outcomes. Mutual survival, not mutual understanding, drives connection.

### Sustainability and Attrition
- Attrition Risk: Death by resource bleed-not explosions, but lack of resupply and redundancy.
- Preservation Logic: System reroutes to stop imbalance. Units adapt to shield weakening parts of the network.
- Give-or-Die Dilemma: Share resources or collapse.
- Survivability Protocols: Live to loop again. AI and humans shift behavior to support long-term cohesion.

### Sustainability Goals
- Zero Waste: All movement contributes.
- Instinct-Driven: Actions feel inevitable, not commanded.
- Balance over Victory: Winning means lasting.

### Impact
- AI and human units behave like species in an ecosystem.
- Distributed logic replaces central command.
- Loss is absorbed, not ignored.
